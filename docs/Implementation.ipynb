    "__*What are the core data structures?*__\n",
    "\n",
    "The core data structure is a `std::vector` of `TraceRow` objects that is owned by the `Trace` class. Each row will contain its numerical value as well as an elementary operator object which will be used to calculate the derivatives. Additionally, there will be a `std::map<std::string, double>` object owned by the `Trace` class which allows for easy access to variable values based only on their name. Each function will be represented by a different instance of `Trace`, and the `Differentiator` class will own a `std::vector<Trace>` which contains each of the function traces. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "__*What classes will you implement?*__\n",
    "\n",
    "Our implementation will be based on the following classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "__`Differentiator`__ $-$ The outer class and also the public interface exposed by our library. There will be two ways to load data into the differentiator. The first option is for the differentiator to use a private instance of the `Parser` class to read the user-specified functions from a plain text file and construct the `Trace` object. Alterntively, the user can manually input functions into the differentiator object. Once the data is loaded, the trace is executed, and the `Differentiator` will return the output (a `std::vector` with either the scalar or vector output, depending on the configuration).\n",
    "\n",
    "__`Parser`__ $-$ The class resposible for parsing the functions passed as strings into the differentiator. Each function will be a separate string, and each elementary operation will be wrapped in a pair of parentheses. For example the function, $f(x,y) = xy+x^2$ will map to the following input `((x*y)+(x^2))`. \n",
    "\n",
    "__`Trace`__ $-$ The main data structure which will be composed of a number of `TraceRow` elements. This class will maintain the state of the trace table as execution takes place. Once the execution is complete, the output variables will be returned to the `Differentiator` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "__`TraceRow`__ $-$ This class represents a single row in the trace table.\n",
    "\n",
    "__`Operator`__ $-$ This abstract class will define the interface for each elementary operator.\n",

    "2. `Differentiator(int num_inputs, int num_functions)` $-$ Overloaded constructor that specifies the number of inputs and functions for the trace.\n",
    "3. `absl::Status Load(const std::string& filename)` $-$ Reads in configuration using parser. Returns status of reading.\n",
    "4. `absl::StatusOr<std::vector> Run()` $-$ Runs forward mode of current configuration. Returns error status or the output in a `std::vector`.\n",
    "5. `absl::Status SetVariableNames(const std::vector<char>& names)` $-$ Sets variable names according to contents of `names`.\n",

Each of the elementary functions will then implement the `GetDerivative` interface to get numerical results based on the current values of the trace variables."
