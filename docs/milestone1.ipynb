    "## Formatting inputs\n",
    "For simplicity, we restrict how inputs should be formatted. \n",
    "\n",
    "We expect functions to be passed into the `Differentiator` as strings. The `Differentiator` is loaded with functions from a file, with all of the functions separated by a newline. \n",
    "\n",
    "Variables should contain alpha characters. Variables that are multiplied together should be denoted with an asterisk, such as: `x*y` vs. `xy`. Variables multiplied by constants should also be multiplied with an asterisk. `3x` may be interpreted as a single variable instead of a variable multiplied with a constant. Similarly, two variables multiplied together without asterisk separation will be read as a single variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Parsing is not whitespace sensitive. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of how function parsing is implemented, a set of parentheses should only contain one operator that is not contained within another set of parentheses. This implies that `(2*((x+y)+z))` is a valid function while `(2*(x+y+z))` is not, even though addition is commutative. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Imports\n",
    "CMake should be installed following these instructions: https://cmake.org/install/\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object Instantiation\n",
    "\n",
    "The only class exposed by the package is the `Differentiator`. \n",
    "\n",
    "It can be constructed as `Differentiator()` or `Differentiator(int num_inputs, int num_functions)`. `Load(const std::string & filename)` is then used to load functions from a file into the `Differentiator` object. All functions must be separated with a newline and conform to the function specfications mentioned above. \n",
    "\n",
    "The user can then interact with this object by running commands such as `Run()` to compute the forward mode of the current configuration or `SetFunction(const std::string& func, int i)` to set the $\\textit{i}$'th function. "
